Desmos is a well laid out site in my opinion. Everything is simple, spread out evenly, and intuitive yet powerful  https://www.desmos.com/calculator/
Github is very powerful, but it is incredibly confusing for first-time users due to weird terminology and hard-to-navigate menus https://github.com/
Moodle is very handy, holds everything together reasonably well, and does a lot of things well, but the color scheme is really weird https://moodle.linnbenton.edu/
Wikipedia is simple, clean, and user-friendly. My favorite so far https://www.wikipedia.org/
Google used to be better, but in recent times the categorical filters like images are no longer always in the same order or even in existance and sponsored suggestions
  have been becoming more and more of the suggestions. Still great at it's job, but less practical for professional use as time goes on https://www.google.com/
